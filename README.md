<h1 align="center">About Me! üòé</h1>

- üè´: Hello! I'm Riley Zhu, and my passion for data analysis was sparked during my undergraduate studies when I encountered the fascinating world of big data. My academic background in Fiannce & Analytics, coupled with hands-on experience as a data analyst on my preivous project & work, has equipped me with a strong foundation in financial forecasting modeling, machine learning and data visualization. Building upon this, I pursued further education at McGill University's Master of Management in Analytics program, where I honed my skills in data analytics and gained practical experience in applying them to some real-world problems.
- üî≠: I'm proficient in various programming languages such as Python (including Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Keras, Scikit-learn, Stats), R, SQL and SAS. Additionally, I'm well-versed in tools like PowerBI, Tableau, Excel (including Pivot Tables, VLOOKUP, VBA). My expertise extends to a range of machine learning models including Regression, Classification, Decision Trees & Random Forest, Gradient Boosting Machines, Neural Network (FNN, CNN, TFT) and Time Series Models (ARIMA, SARIMAX).
